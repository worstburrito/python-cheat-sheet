## Variables
```python
# Variables are labels you can assign and reassign values to
message = "Python is so awesome to learn!"
print(message)
# Output: Python is so awesome to learn!

# If you reassign a variable and print it again, it will change
message = "I love learning Python!"
print(message)
# Output: I love learning Python!

# Variables have rules, such as:
# They can only contain letters, numbers and underscores
# They cannot start with numbers
# Spaces are not allowed, you use underscores instead
# Avoid using words that Python uses for operations and functions
# Examples:
# message_1, my_message
```

## Strings
